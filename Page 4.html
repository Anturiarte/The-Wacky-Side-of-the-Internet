      <h2> 5 Weird Youtube Channels </h2>
     <h3>1. cyriak  </h3>
      <p> This is a channel with over 800k subscribers, based on making weird and sometimes creepy animations and the creator behind these animations is a freelance animator based somewhere in the UK.</p>
      <h3>2. HowTobasic </h3>
      <p> This is a channel with over 8 million subscribers inwhich a guy plays the role of a mental person and just starts destroying things and also has an obsession with eggs. </p>
      <h3>3. GizmoSlip </h3>
      <p> This is a channel with over 2.5 million subscribers and is probably the least odd on the list. The reason I decided to add this channel on the list is because they have this series inwhich they drop an iphone from the top of a building and see if the iphone can survive the impact if they put something around the iphone. </p>
      <h3>4. Hydraulic Press Channel </h3>
      <p> This is a channel with about 1.5 million subscribers, and the whole point of this channel is to see videos of stuff getting crushed by a Hydraulic Press and honestly is really amusing to watch.</p>
      <h3>5. JoeysWorldTour </h3>
      <p> This is a channel with about 167k subscribers and is a really funny, weird, and interesting channel. This channel is about food reviews given by a middle aged man who just goes into drive thru's and reviews food while eating it in a gross way.</p>
