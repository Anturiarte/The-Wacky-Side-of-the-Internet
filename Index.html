  <h2> Why make a guide to the wacky side of the internet?</h2>
  <p>    There are over a billion websites on the internet and even if you checked
     out 3 thousand websites a day, it would still take you way over 2000 years
      to visit every single one, so it wont be that easy for someone to stumble
      upon any wacky or strange websites out there because most of the websites on internet are work related and broing. Thats why I decided that instead of making you go on a witchhunt looking
       for these bizzare, wacky, and entertaining sities. I could just make you a guide and make ur wacky
      exploraton 20 times easier. I decided that there are also so much more wacky things to
      explore on the internet then just websites so I will also so include youtube channels/videos
      , Image galleries, and much more. You might also ask, Why the wacky side of the internet?.
       There are many reasons on why I decided to make a guide to the wacky part/side of the internet. First reason
      being that the wacky side of the internet is really entertaining in general and really
    makes you question what on earth some people were thinking. Second reason being is to appreciate and realize the wacky parts of the internet
    alot of times arent even meant to be wacky and are supposed to be considered art or entertainment. Keep in mind that all this wacky content will be appropriate for school and will be somewhat kid friendly.
